## Overview 
- This challenge was to use MySQL and Javascript and Node js to finish the backend and use the frontend that was provided for the starter code. The purpose of this challenge was to solidify our understanding of MySQL and node js. The front end was already there so the next step was to make the models and routes and then connect to the database. Once connected, the next step was to use the different routes an update, delete, and add to the different models using Insomnia. This challenge especially helped me with my understanding of MySQL since I had to connect the database and I used MySQL workbench to better understand the columns and rows. 
## Challenges & Successes
- Sequelize and MySQL
    - Big shoutout to the TA's at my bootcamp. I was having trouble getting sequelize to connect and then I was locked out of MySQL. George and Kirtley helped me uninstall MySQL and then redownload it and change the password. Once that was changed they helped me get the database back for this challenge by running 'source' in mysql in the terminal. 
- The app works like it's supposed to which is a success and the database is connected properly.
## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- MySQL and Sequelize
- Node.js
- Insomnia 
## Installation 
- First perform a git clone of the repository and then open the server (by writing the command node server.js) in the terminal. Once the server is running, then you can use insomnia to update the different models (product, category, tags) and you can view the code to see how it was created. 
## Credits 
- George Yoo and Kirtley (TA's in University of Denver BootCamp) specifically with the connection.js, server.js and database. I was struggling with sequelize to connect to the server and they helped me to get it to work properly.
